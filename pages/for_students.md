### To my students 
(or those who are interested in joining my group)


#### Useful General Information
- **Proposal deadlines** 
    1. *Submillimeter Array (SMA):* mid March and September. More in [SMAOC](http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/proposing.html).
    2. *Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA):* Feb./Aug. 01 every year. More in [My NRAO](https://my.nrao.edu/) (please register an account).
    3. *Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)* Around Apr. 20 every year. More in [ALMA User Portal](https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/).
    4. *Various optical or infrared telescopes:* Mostly in March or September every year.
    5. *Others :* I may once in a while notify you (by E-mails) something worth trying.
- **Literature**
    1. *New papers :* Browse [arXiv/astro-ph](https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new) everyday is a good habit.
    2. *Existing journal papers :* You can use this interface [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/classic-form) to find them.
- **Editing**
    1. We use LaTEX for text editing. A good introduction of Latex can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes). But I would recommend simply downloading a template and then start working with it instead of following through the introduction. Please register and use this online interface [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) such that I can directly revise your works online.
    2. Please use [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to check through your text make sure there is no typos or grammatical errors before inviting me to work on it.
- **Programing and Project Management**
    1. You are very strongly encouraged to use at least the basic function of [Github](https://github.com/) to maintain your programing projects. You can include some Jupyter notebook in some repositories and pass the link for me to preview. If you are confused about how to generate SSH key, a Chinese documentation can be found [here](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10205988). If you are not paying for an Overleaf account, it is good to use Github to maintain versions or backups of your papers and thesis.
    2. You can use the *Markdown* language to make comments or explanations on your Jupyter notebook. A good Chinese introduction can be found  [here](https://markdown.tw/). The official [cheet sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is also handy.
    3. You can do your work with Python. I used to be using something else but am switching over ot Python. For astrophysicists, the most frequently used packages are [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/); we use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [aplpy](https://aplpy.github.io/) to produce publication-level figures. Those plotting packages are very poorly documented. If you have trouble using them, please ask other senior students in my group or ask me. Since all packages are dynamically evolving, it is necessary to maintain your packages using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Start using it from **day-1** otherwise you will encounter infinite troubles in the future.
- **Career Planing**
    If you need some advice, you may either discuss with me or try to contact my former students.



#### Attitude

1. If you are my paid students or you are trying to be my paid student, you are required to watch these videos about [Research Excellence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoYfgw4PQAU) and [Ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06voT30bQW4) and make sure you understand them.
2. You are required to check and reply (within the same date) my E-Mails at least once every working-day except when you are traveling or are taking a leave. When it is within 1 week ahead of the deadlines of the observational proposals that you are attempting, check E-Mails and reply often every day, regardless whether or not it is working days or if you are taking leaves.
3. If you want to take off (e.g., for days or weeks), let me know. Discuss with me if you want to take off for more than a week. Do not simply disappear.
4. If you violate the typical practice of ethics in the academic field (e.g., if you use other people's work but without properly crediting them), or if you miss to meet the requirements in the second or third points multiple times (which are requirements for most of the paid jobs), I may stop paying you.
5. I will try to pay the amount that I agreed to pay you. But that depends on whether or not I can aquire enough budget from the Ministry of Science and Technology (科技部). We need to maintain our publication records in order to continue acquiring enough budget. In case of not acquiring enough budget, the stipend will be adjusted depending on your contribution.
6. We are working with colleagues all over the world. Do not discriminate. Do not bug anybody with political issues (if they want to discuss, then it is OK to discuss with them. But do not try to make people feel uncomfortable. You need to know when you want to stop it).



#### Requirement
-**To get Master's degree** 
    The requirement is to use some existing methods/codes to accomplish the analyses of some existing data. Developing your own codes/methods or taking your own observational data are encouraged.
  1. *To stay in an academic career track :* You will likely need one journal publication (as 1st author) if you would like to study abroad. Examples of such Master's thesis work are these papers ([Li et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...840...72L/abstract); [Ko et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889..172K/abstract)). Without such a publication, you applications will most likely fail. To go to a domestic Ph.D. program, it depends on where you are going to; the requirements are different. In most cases, you are NOT welcome to staying in my group for over 2 years and continue with a Ph.D. program but exceptions can be made (e.g., if you have 2-body issues or any other specific reasons to stay in the same town).
  2. *To switch to an industrial career track :* Please discuss with me what you need to accomplish before getting a degree.
  3. *If you are not sure :* Please discuss with me from time to time. But please remember that you are the one who is responsible for your own life. Try to make good use of your time.
  
-**To get Ph.D. degree**
    You are required to develop your own methods/codes, or come up with your own hypotheses and accomplish the test of those hypotheses. The minimum requirement would be producing one journal publication out of such works. If I think you can do better than that, the requirement may become higher (in such cases, your stipend may be higher too).
  1. *To stay in an academic career track :* It is safe if you publish at least 3 journal papers as the first author before you apply a Postdoctoral position anywhere. 
  2. *To switch to an industrial career track :* Please discuss with me what you need to accomplish before getting a degree.
  
-**Thesis Timeline**
    Please discuss from time to time when you want to defend. You need to bring up your final version of draft at least 2 months ahead of the defense such that we have time to iterate on improving it. You need to foward a revised draft to your thesis committee at least a month ahead of the deadline such that they have time to preview it.
    
-**Course Works**
    I do not care about your grades. Just passing them is fine for me. But if you think you need to teach any subject as a professor in the future, you better do a good job. Most of my colleagues express that they have no time (at all) to read any book during the 5~6 years of postdoc's life.
