# Radio Interferometry

**2022-Oct-5/Nov-30 @ NTNU :** *Practical Radio Interferometry* ([Lecture Homepage](https://github.com/baobabyoo/Lecture_RadioInterferometry_2022Oct)). I am not yet good at using Github. But let's learn this together.

    1. [Lecture notes: Principle of radiation and basic observational parameters](https://github.com/baobabyoo/Lecture_RadioInterferometry_2022Oct/blob/main/lecture_notes/RadioAstronomy_2022Oct_lecture1_NTNU.pdf)

**2022-Jul-08/12 @ NTNU :** *Principle of interferometry, noise, and calibration strategy.* ( [Lecture Notes PDF](https://github.com/baobabyoo/baobabyoo.github.io/blob/main/pages/files/lecture_notes/2022/Radio_interferometry_2022Jul.pdf); go to the address and then click the **Download** button to download). These are my quick notes, which are not necessarily fully correct and may not be comphresensitve to those who did not attend the classes.
