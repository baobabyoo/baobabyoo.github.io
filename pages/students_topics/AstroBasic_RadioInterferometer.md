### Radio Interferometry (or, aperture synthesis technique)

#### Why interferometry?

Analyzing interferometric data can be hard. It has been a nightmare to many astronomy/astrophysics students. This technique worths 0.5 Nobel Prize ([to Sir Martin Ryle, in 1974](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1974/summary/)).
In my experience, it takes a full-time student 2-6 months to master this technique, to the level that they can process data and troubleshoot independently. During this time period, both the trainer and trainee need to devote considerable amount of time. So, in fact, most of our colleagues do not pick it up. People who have mastered radio interferometry are relatively unique.

So why use interferometry at all? How does the pain pay off?
{: .fs-2 }

**This is all about the need for resolution.**
{: .fs-2 }

For a telescope, with a lens or reflector that has a diameter *D*, at a wavelength *L*, the angular resolution is approximately **L/D [in units of radian]** (i.e., to convert it to degree unit, you multiple *L/D* by (180/pi); to convert from degree to arcsecond unit, you multiple another factor of 3600). At a certain wavelength, if you want to achieve better and better angular resolution, then you need to build bigger and bigger telescopes. This is particularly bad when you are observing at (sub)millimeter or radio (i.e., centimeter or decimeter) wavelength bands. In such cases, the *L* is much longer than the that in the optical or near-infrared observations. Those gigantic radio telescopes almost look like Gundams!

The Large Millimeter Telescope ([LMT](http://lmtgtm.org/); ~70-350 GHz) in Mexico has a dish with 50-meter diameter, which is almost as big as the playground in a typical elementary school in Taiwan. Presently, the biggest movable *single-dish* radio telescopes are the [Green Bank 100-meter telescope](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/telescopes/gbt/) and [Effelsberg 100-meter telescope](https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/en/effelsberg).  Beyond this size, it becomes unrealistic to find material that is hard enough to make the mechanical structures. The surface of such big single-dish telescopes may considerably deform when you slew the telescope, due to gravity. It also deforms when the wind is blowing. Due to the large inertia, these big telescopes usually can only slew very slowly, which makes it difficult to observe multiple target sources or map a big region. To alleviate the mechanical problems, the bigger radio telescopes are not movable, for example, the [Arecibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory) telescope and the [FAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope) observatory. The observations with such static dishes are subject to some limitations, as expected.
{: .fs-2 }

The radio interferometry technique sheds light on this problem. Based on physics/mathematical principles, we can build an **array** of telescopes that have small dishes. The interferometry technique allows us to to-some-extent take this array as an equivalent, big single-dish telescope, of which the diameter is comparable with the **largest projected separation** of the smaller telescopes in our array. Here, projection means we project the spatial distribution of the array to a plane that is perpendicular to the line-of-sight toward the astronomical source being observed. We call the process to put together the signals taken from individuals of the small telescopes **making correlation**. The hardware or software device to make correlation is called **correlator**. Each of the small telescopes are easy to fabricate. The technical difficulties are deferred to the stage of making correlation. Most of the difficulties are hidden from the users in the present date observatories, but not all. Sometimes, you still need to deal with the not-yet-so-well correlated signals by **calibrating** them. When planning the interferometric observations, you need to follow a strategy to enable proper data calibration. These are what make it hard to use radio and (sub)millimeter interferometry. But it really isn't that bad already! Don't be scared away! Also, a Master's or Ph.D. degree is not supposed to be trivial. If you are expecting something difficult enough to warrant a part of a degree, this is it.
{: .fs-2 }

Fortunately, we are really coming to the era that the big interferometric radio or (sub)millimeter observatories (e.g., [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/)) are offering good support. Nowadays, one can choose to use some of them in a way that most of the complicated mathematical principles are hidden from the user. To enable you to use [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/) this way, or make query to the [archival observations of ALMA](https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/aq/), in the following, I will introduce some of the basic terminologies. Then, I will introduce how we normally use these interferometric observatories. It will mostly stay at a qualitative level, which intends to be a minimal set of knowledge that you need to know before using ALMA like taking a picture with a point-and-shoot camera. If I have time, I may host the mathematical details at other places for the advanced users. The details about the ALMA hardwares can be referenced from the official ALMA [Technical Handbook](https://almascience.nao.ac.jp/proposing/technical-handbook). If you want to be a black belt ALMA user, at some point, it may become inevitable to read through this very thick technical handbook.

#### How a radio interferometer look like?

###### Looking from outside

You can find the pictures of the modern radio or (sub)millimeter interferometers such as the [SMA](http://sma1.sma.hawaii.edu/smaoc.html) (200-400 GHz), [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/) (90-1000 GHz), [JVLA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/) (0.05-50 GHz), [GMRT](http://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/) (0.1-1.5 GHz), [ASKAP](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/index.html) (0.7-1.8 GHz), [MeerKat](https://www.sarao.ac.za/gallery/meerkat/) (0.6-15 GHz), [VLBA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vlba) (0.3-90 GHz), [EHT](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/array) (230 GHz), and so on. These are the *dish arrays* (i.e., each element in the array is a single-dish telescope). In fact, some of the dishes of the ALMA array are used as single-dish telescopes, which is called the *Total Power (TP)* array. I will focus more on the dish arrays in the following.
{: .fs-2 }

We correlate the signal taken from every pair of telescopes (i.e., every two of them). We call a pair of telescopes a **baseline**.
{: .fs-2 }

Besides dish array, there are also radio interferometers that are composed of dipole antennae without dishes, such as [LOFAR](https://www.astron.nl/telescopes/lofar/), [LWA](https://leo.phys.unm.edu/~lwa/index.html), [OVRO-LWA](http://www.tauceti.caltech.edu/LWA/). They are operating at low frequency bands (<1 GHz, typically). The interferometric principles they are based on are the same as that for the dish arrays. However, the response functions of  is these diple antennae are very different. Usually, these dipole arrays can simultaneously observe the whole sky. OVRO-LWA performing all sky monitoring routinely. Otherwise, they can use the *[beamforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming)* technique to observe some selected patches on the sky with high angular-resolution.
{: .fs-2 }

The dish collects the incoming light. The bigger the dish size, the more light it can collect in a unit of time, meaning that the **sensitivity** is better. For both single-dish telescope or interferometry, **sensitivity** is usually expressed in intensity units, which has dimension of *energy per unit area per unit solid angle per unit time per unit observing-frequency*. For instance, we can express the sensitivity as the intensity of an equivalent black body, e.g., we say our brightness sensitivity is 1 Kelvin. This means that, after we are done with all the calibration and produce an image, which includes both the *emission of the target source* and the *thermal white noise*, the root-mean-square of the intensity fluctuation contributed by the thermal white noise corresponds to the intensity of the black body emission at 1 K temperature. We call the temperature of such equivalent black body the **[brightness temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness_temperature)**. For most of the present-date radio or (sub)millimeter interferometry, the noise statistics are indeed approximately Gaussian (i.e., white). Then for example, if your target source is a 6000 K black body emitter, for example, our Sun, and if you want to resolve it at 10-sigma significance, then you need to achieve an rms noise level of 600 K. An ALMA image on the Sun can be found [here](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/announcements/alma-starts-observing-the-sun/).
{: .fs-2 }

The longer you integrate on the target source with the observations, the better sensitivity (i.e., the lower rms noise level) you can achieve. Since the noise follows the Gaussian statistics, the noise level is inversely proportional to the square-root of the on-source integration time. Having a bigger dish, you can achieve the same noise level with a shorter on-source integration time. To achieve a good sensitivity, it is better to build many small dishes instead of a few big dishes. You will see the reason in the following. Also note that the telescope cannot be arbitrarily small. There needs a minimum space to host the other hardware devices including the receivers and the cryogenic systems for the receivers, etc, which will also be introduced later.
{: .fs-2 }

In astronomical observations, we also often express intensity or sensitivity in the unit call **Jy beam<sup>-1</sup>** (pronounced as Jansky per beam). [Jy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jansky) is the unit for flux density, which has a dimension of  *energy per unit area per unit time per unit observing frequency*, i.e., flux density is integrated intensity over solid angle (e.g, the solid angle of your target source). *Jansky per beam* denotes the flux density in a *unit resolution element* in your image. If your resolution element is a Gaussian beam, you can convert between the brightness temperature and the Jy beam<sup>-1</sup> based on the formula given in [this page](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/proposing/TBconv).
{: .fs-2 }

So what is the *unit resolution element*? As a start, you comprehend it as a shape (e.g., a circle) which occupies a certain solid angle in the image domain.
It is only slightly more complicated than that. Precisely speaking, the **resolution** describes the *angular response function* of your telescope. For a single-dish radio telescope that the dish diameter is *d*, at observing wavelength *L*, that response function may be approximated by a two-dimensional gaussian that has a [full-width-at-half-maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_width_at_half_maximum#:~:text=In%20a%20distribution%2C%20full%20width,half%20of%20its%20maximum%20value.) around 1.22 times *L/d*. The image you obtained from the observations is the intensity distribution of your astronomical source (for example, a nebula) **convolved** with this response function. Fundamentally, you cannot distinguish the following two cases: (1) two point-like sources that have a separation closer than 1-sigma Gaussian width of the response function, and (2) a relatively spatially extended source (e.g., the angular scale is comparably larger than your response function). To distinguish these two cases, we mush improve the angular resolution, for example, by using the same single-dish telescope to observe at a higher frequency (i.e., shorter wavelength), or by performing the interferometric follow-up observations at higher angular resolution.
The solid angle of the response function can be obtained by integrating over the whole angular range. If you are interested in the mathematical details, you can check Section 3.3.3 of [this page](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch3.html).
{: .fs-2 }

For an interferometer array, we call the response function provided by the dish, the function that the characteristic angular scale is given by *L/d* [in radian units], the **primary beam** of the observations. Emission from the target sources that are located outside of the primary beam is significantly attenuated. Sometimes, people also refer to the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian primary beam simply as *primary beam*. This FWHM is approximately the **simultaneous field-of-view** of the interferometric observations on a single pointing (i.e., observations that track a specific coordinates instead of scanning).  The longer wavelength you observe, the bigger simultaneous field-of-view (or primary beam) you have.
{: .fs-2 }

The resolution element of a modern interferometer array (e.g., ALMA) is also approximately a two-dimensional gaussian, although the major and minor axes of this Gaussian response function may not be equal. So you need to describe this two-dimensional gaussian resolution element with the major axis, minor axis, and position angle, e.g., it is often expressed as something like (0".5 x 0".5; P.A.=10 degree). We call this resolution element a **synthesized beam**. The major and minor axes of this resolution element is determined by the largest projected separations *B<sub>max</sub>* of the telescopes in the interferometer array. That is the major or minor axis of the resolution element is approximately *L/B<sub>max</sub>*. A very special aspect is that the smallest projected separations *B<sub>min</sub>* (e.g., 1000 meters) of the telescopes determins the **largest recoverable angular scale** of your interferometric observations. The observed intensity of any structure that is spatially more extended than *L/B<sub>min</sub>* will be very significant attenuated. That is, an interferometer is working like a spatial high-pass filter.
{: .fs-2 }

Note that if you express the sensitivity of an interferometer in units of Jy beam<sup>-1</sup>, the sensitivity will be independent of the solid angle of your synthesized beam. We say that the point-source sensitivity of an interferometer is independent of angular resolution. However, if you express it in units of Kelvin, it will be better (i.e., corresponds to a lower temperature) if you are using a coarser angular resolution (i.e., a synthesized beam with a bigger solid angle).
{: .fs-2 }

The values of *B<sub>max</sub>* and *B<sub>min</sub>* are determined by the **array configuration**, which describes how you locate the telescopes in an array. Many modern interferometers (e.g., ALMA, SMA, JVLA) can reconfigure the array, i.e., moving telescopes from certain pads to the others. SMA has four different array configurations, namely the subcompact, compact, extended, and very extended array configurations. The most extended array configuration offers the best achievable angular resolution, however, also filters out a lot of extended emission. To recover the extended emission, we can combine the observations taken with the observations taken in the compact array configuration, and the observations taken with the single-dish telescopes. Similarly, ALMA has the C-1, C-2, ..., C-10 array configuration (from the most compact to the most extended), and JVLA has the D, C, B, and A array configurations (from the most compact to the most extended). JVLA rotate throughs these four array configurations approximately every 1.5 years (see the [array configuration schedule](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/proposing/configpropdeadlines)). For a student, it is good to keep in mind when you should propose the observations you need, otherwise, you may miss the timeline for graduation!
{: .fs-2 }

In general, we want an array to have small *B<sub>min</sub>* such that we can recover the angularly extended astronomical emission sources. Mechanically, *B<sub>min</sub>* cannot be smaller than your dish diameter $d$. Otherwise, when you slew the telescopes, their dishes will collide with each other. That is one motivation to use many small dishes instead of a few large dishes. In addition, small dishes also provide bigger simultaneous-field-view than big dishes, which is advantageous when performing mapping experiments or blind surveys of certain types of astronomical sources. However, the more telescope you build, the more receivers you need to build. This part is costly. And the hardware or software power to correlate the incoming signal scales as the square of the number of telescopes. Since we usually do not have unlimited budget, these also need to be taken into consideration when building an interferometry array.
{: .fs-2 }

There are also optical and infrared interferometers, for example, the [Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI)](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti.html) and the [CHARA](https://www.chara.gsu.edu/). They can achieve extremely high angular resolution thanks to the short operational wavelengths. Looking from outside, they appear very similar to the radio or (sub)millimeter interferometer arrays. But the receiver techniques and the way to correlate signals from individual telescopes are very different from those of the radio or (sub)millimeter interferometer arrays. For the radio or (sub)millimeter interferometer arrays, these aspects are introduced in the following.
