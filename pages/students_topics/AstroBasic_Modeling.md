## Data Modelings

### References

- I gave a lecture about this topic. You may find some of the material/codes in [this page](https://github.com/baobabyoo/Lecture_DataAnalysis) useful.
- I learned the basics from [Numerical Recipes, 3rd ed.](http://numerical.recipes/book/book.html).
- The [tutorial of emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides pedagogical examples of how to properly use this Python package.
- [Hogg, D. W. et al. 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010arXiv1008.4686H/abstract) introduces the basics about data modeling, and in addition, how to handling model uncertainties.
- My former student, Yuxin Lin, recommended me to use the [NumPyro](https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/) and [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) packages. This has been in my todo list forever.
