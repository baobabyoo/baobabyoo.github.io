### Proposal Writing

Research is expensive. Why does it matter? That is what you need to convincingly address in your proposal (or application to various positions/jobs).

On most occasions, the reviewers will not be familiar with your work. In addition, during the initial screening (to reject the majority of applications), they may not want to spend time reading your proposals/applications. We need to learn to deal with such occasions.

The general guidelines are:
- **Start early.** Usually, you need to polish your important proposals many times. And sometimes you need to sit on your draft for days or weeks before coming back to polish it with refreshed eyes/mind.
- **Use a positive tone.**
- **Avoid jargon.**
    If you do not have a sense of what is jargon, ask your friends who are not in the same research field to proofreading your proposal. Also, do not use too many acronyms. For people who cannot remember the actual meanings of the acronyms, your proposal will become unreadable. 
- **Spend time preparing nice figures.**
    1. Anything appearing on your figure should be readable and understandable. The best is that people can pick up most of the ideas without reading into the caption.
    2. Use proper font sizes in the labels. 
    3. One figure should only convey one or two ideas at most. If you have many points to make, create more figures.
    4. If you are making a contour plot, do not entangle the contours of multiple images. Usually, I would not consider presently more than 2 images in a contour plot.
    5. Do not have a big blank space in your figure. Take good advantage of the space you can use.
    6. Try various color-codings or color-maps until your figure appears as a nice designed work. Do not use the saturated default RGB.
- **Avoid typos and grammatical errors.**
- **Tailor your proposal for the prospective readers.** For example, if you know someone is going to review your proposal, then do not attack their work.
- **Be honest.** Do not propose what you are not going to do.
