### Proposal Writing

Research is expensive. Why does it matter? That is what you need to convincingly address in your proposal (or application to various positions/jobs).

On most occasions, the reviewers will not be familiar with your work. In addition, during the initial screening (to reject the majority of applications), they may not want to spend time reading your proposals/applications. We need to learn to deal with such occasions.

The general guidelines are:
- **Start early.** Usually, you need to polish your important proposals many times. And sometimes you need to sit on your draft for days or weeks before coming back to polish it with refreshed eyes/mind.
- **Use a positive tone.**
- **Avoid jargon.**
    If you do not have a sense of what is jargon, ask your friends who are not in the same research field to proofreading your proposal. Also, do not use too many acronyms. For people who cannot remember the actual meanings of the acronyms, your proposal will become unreadable. 
- **Spend time preparing nice figures.**
    1. Anything appearing on your figure should be readable and understandable. The best is that people can pick up most of the ideas without reading into the caption.
    2. Use proper font sizes in the labels. 
    3. One figure should only convey one or two ideas at most. If you have many points to make, create more figures.
    4. If you are making a contour plot, do not entangle the contours of multiple images. Usually, I would not consider presently more than 2 images in a contour plot.
    5. Do not have a big blank space in your figure. Take good advantage of the space you can use.
    6. Try various color-codings or color-maps until your figure appears as a nice designed work. Do not use the saturated default RGB.
- **Avoid typos and grammatical errors.**
- **Tailor your proposal for the prospective readers.** For example, if you know someone is going to review your proposal, then do not attack their work.
- **Be honest.** Do not propose what you are not going to do.

### Observational Proposal

OK, so you are coming to Stage-1.

The academic field is competitive in nature. Unless you are super-rich, it will not just be a matter of what you want to do. Why the money or any other kinds of resources have to be invested in you instead of in the other people?  What is your potential? Can you justify your competitiveness? It is never too late to think about this. Composing an observational proposal would be your first experience with this.

Depending on where you are, every 10~30 Ph.D. students, only one will get a research job. The competitive observatories (e.g., ALMA, JVLA) typically have oversubscription rates of 4~5, meaning that only 1 over every 4~5 proposals will be approved and be allocated with observing time (although in this case, you are directly competing with professors and postdocs). Persistently winning observing-time is not only important for maintaining your research but is also a convincing way of justifying that you are the one who has the potential to get to the next stage. 

 Writing observational proposals is one means to benchmark your competitiveness and sharpen your thinking. 
 
 If you have successful proposals to very competitive observatories, you can include those records in your CV. (But note that this is subtle. This is a way to justify that you are capable of acquiring resources. But if you cannot convert them into journal publications, such records can hurt your applications in the end.)
 
 Most observatories call for the proposals once or twice every year. This is the duty-cycle for you to acquire data. Mark the relevant deadlines on your calendar and reserve your time. If you are preparing a proposal for the very first time, and if you are not a native English speaker, you will probably need at least 3 full weeks (including weekends). You will spend perhaps a week reading the **call-for-proposal** and checking the technical details, a week drafting the proposal including making the figures, and a week polishing the writing. If you have senior co-investigators, make sure you circulate them a draft at least a week ahead of the deadline, otherwise, they will be busy on other people's proposals or on their own proposals.
 
 Most of the proposals are composed of a **Title**, **Abstract**, a **Scientific+Technical Justification** (usually 2 pages of text and 2 pages of figures/tables in PDF format). In some cases, the **Technical Justification** may need to be filled to the online forms of those specific observatories. In such cases, it is still good to include some basic explanations for your technical setups in your PDF document. You should check exactly what is required in the form(s) early, and make sure you know how to fill them. For example, there can be check boxes asking whether you would like to use `OTF mode` or `raster scans`. Then you better know what they are.
 
 Some tips for composing those parts of a proposal are outlined below.

##### Title

Try not to use more than 90 English characters (in many cases, this is the text hard-limit).

Spend time on making a title that precisely and concisely conveys what you are trying to do. What questions you are trying to address? What is the advantage of your experiment? 

For an example, the title of one of my recent successful proposal is `How to Make an Earth that is Deficient in Water?`. The Abstract of this proposal will be shown in the next section.

A bad example would be `13CS 5-4 line observations towards molecular cloud G123.45-6.78`. Most of the readers will not have an idea about what is the 13CS 5-4 line and what is special about the molecular cloud G123.45-6.78. For such people, this title conveys absolutely no information.


##### Abstract

Try not to use more than 200 English words (in most cases, this is the text hard-limit).

This might be a bit about style. But if you are composing a proposal for the very first time, the following pattern might be something easy to begin with:

1. One or two sentences to provide a big picture of your research area, or to convey the importance and generality of your research.
2. One or two sentences to introduce your hypotheses that will be tested in this experiment.
3. Two to three sentences to explain how you are going to test your hypotheses (e.g., the target source you select, your spectral setup or angular resolution, and so on).
4. One or two sentences to introduce how you are going to analyze your data.
5. One sentence to justify how your results will make an impact on the research field. 

The Abstract for my proposal `How to Make an Earth that is Deficient in Water?` is:


`The asteroid belt (~2 au from the Sun) in the Solar System is made of solid material that is deficient in water. So are the Earth and Mars. Since these dry solid bodies are located within the 170 K water snowline, we are motivated to consider that they formed in-situ out of a dry path of dust grain coagulation, which implies that water-ice free dust grains are stickier than what used to be considered. In spite that this possibility has been rarely considered in the previous observational frameworks, it is supported by the latest laboratory experiments. To test our hypothesis, it is necessary to probe dust grain sizes inwards of the water snowlines in protoplanetary disks. This is challenging since these regions are very small in general (<1~2 au). We propose the 2-48 GHz radio spectro-polarimetric observations towards the nearest and the brightest FUor-like object L1551IRS5 in which the luminous accretion outburst has significantly enlarged the water snowline. Based on SED analysis and diagnosing dust linear polarization due to self-scattering, we aim to test whether or not the >1 mm sized dust grains predominately reside inwards of the snowline. This unique experiment will fundamentally advance our understanding of terrestrial planet-formation.`

Once you become familiarized with proposal writing, you can follow your own style. Sometimes, I also immediately point out my experimental setup in the first sentence, for example, `We request to make the first measurement of the linear polarization of the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, at ALMA Band 8 and 9. The main science goals are ......`
