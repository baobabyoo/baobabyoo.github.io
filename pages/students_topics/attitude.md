#### Attitude

1. If you are my paid student or you are trying to be my paid student, you are required to watch these videos about [Research Excellence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoYfgw4PQAU) and [Ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06voT30bQW4) and make sure you understand them. I am required by the funding agency to watch them too.
2. You are required to check and reply (within the same date) to my E-Mails at least once every working-day except when you are traveling or are taking a leave. When it is within 1 week ahead of the deadlines of the observational proposals that you are attempting, check E-Mails and reply often every day, regardless of whether or not it is working days or if you are taking leaves.
3. If you want to take a leave (e.g., for days or weeks), let me know. Discuss with me if you want to take off for more than a week. Do not simply disappear without letting me know.
4. If you violate the typical practice of ethics in the academic field (e.g., if you use other people's work but without properly crediting them), or if you miss meeting the requirements in the second or third points multiple times (which are requirements for most of the paid jobs), I may stop paying you. If someone try to steal your work, let me know. It is my responsibility to speak up for you.
5. I will try to pay the amount that I agreed to pay you. But that depends on whether or not I can acquire enough budget from the Ministry of Science and Technology (科技部). We need to maintain our publication records in order to continue acquiring enough budget. In case of not acquiring enough budget, the stipend will be adjusted depending on your contribution.
6. We are working with colleagues all over the world. Do not discriminate. Do not bug anybody with political issues (if they are willing or eager to discuss, then it is OK to discuss with them. But do not try to make people feel uncomfortable. You need to know when you want to stop it).
7. If you want someone to understand you or your work, it is your responsibility to explain yourself well. In addition, it should not require so much effort or time to understand you, such that people will tend to give up. Always try to be able to summarize what you are doing in no more than three sentences. 
8. My recommend letters will be realistic. You can expect a very positive letter if you impress me with your work a few times, otherwise, not.
