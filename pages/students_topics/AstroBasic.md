### Basic Astrophysics

I am making overviews for certain areas that I know. These overviews intend to make my own students quickly pick up some basic knowledge that they will hopefully not forget so easily forget. And if they forget, they can always come back to check. In case you have any suggestion about the material, you are very welcome to contact me too.

These overviews are mostly staying at a qualitative level, i.e., even citizens who have no discipline in science should be able to follow a good part of them.
I am providing some links to the deeper material that one can access for free.
I may find other places to host the deeper discussion too.

Presently, these overviews are in English. This is because not all of my students can read Chinese. In case you feel interested in mirroring these pages and translating them into Chinese, please feel free to contact me. I can help you if there is anything that is not so clear to you (this may happen since I am not a native English speaker).
