## Radiative Transfer

### References

- The lecture of Dr. Cornelis P. Dullemond of is very useful, which can be found [here](https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/lectures/radtrans_2012/index.shtml).
- We can perform 3D Monte Carto Radiative Transfer (MCRT) simulations using the [RADMC-3D](https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/) codes. The documentation for this code is also a very good material for learning radiative transfer.
