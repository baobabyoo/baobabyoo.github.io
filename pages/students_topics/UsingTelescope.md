Here I try to summarize the tips of using certain telescopes.
If you are using these telescopes, try to follow these tips first.
If there is anything that is not clear to you, come to ask me.
I wil then try to improve these guides accordingly.

If you have used any telescope that is not mentioned here, you are welcome to compose the tips if you think those will be useful to your colleagues.
