### If this is your first time

If you are my postdoc, and if you need me to revise English or double check the technical setup, forward me your first draft at least **2 weeks** ahead of the proposal deadline.
{: .fs-1 }

If you are my student, forward me your first draft at least **4 weeks** ahead of the proposal deadline. I will spend time iterating with you many times for education purposes.

### Chapter 1. Proposing

#### 1.1 Timeline and interface

**There are two proposal deadlines each year, usually on February 01 and August 01 except when these dates are in the weekends.**
{: .fs-2 }

Please register an **account** at the [NRAO graphical interface](https://my.nrao.edu/) well ahead of the proposal deadline (e.g., one month ahead or earlier). You need to log in and familiarize yourself with how to prepare for the cover-page online. In addition, all of your co-Is will need to register to this interface otherwise they cannot be included. You need to inform your co-Is early enough such that the have time to process this.
{: .fs-2 }

The JVLA capability has been evolving. Please read the [Call for Proposals](https://science.nrao.edu/observing/call-for-proposals) well ahead of the deadline to understand what capability has become available for your experiment(s). In each proposal deadline, the available array configuration(s) is also different. Please check the [Array Configuration Schedule](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/proposing/configpropdeadlines) well ahead of the deadline and check the [Angular resolution and Largest Angular Scale](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/oss/performance/resolution) of the available array configuration(s). This is necessary information for planning your experiment(s).
{: .fs-2 }

Usually, you try to form a rough idea about what you are going to propose (target source(s), array configuration, frequency band(s) and correlator setup, and sensitivity). Let's say, this is at least 1~1.5 months ahead of the proposal deadline. If you are my student and postdoc, please come discuss with me about this rough idea.
{: .fs-2 }

#### 1.2 Preparation-1: Feasibility, complementary data, and duplication

**After we agree that this idea is worth pursuing and is technically feasible
, you should use the [NRAO Data Archive](https://data.nrao.edu/portal/) to check whether or not you are duplicating historical or ongoing projects.** In the case that you are duplicating, you can (1) give up and try to come up with other proposal ideas, or (2) download the archival data can see if the calibrated data can achieve the quality that is needed for your science purpose. If the quality of the archival data is fair, then just continue to use that data to proceed with your research. If there is no archival data or if the quality of the archival data is poor, you can go ahead to complete the preparation of your proposal. **You need to explicitly and convincingly explain what was the problem with the archival data if it exists. So prepare your proposal well ahead of the deadline** in case you really need to look into some archival data or need other colleagues to check the archival for you. Close to the deadline, they (and I) have to prepare their own proposals thus may refuse to help you.
{: .fs-2 }

**Do not waster your (and my) time to prepare a proposal that has a problem with unnecessary duplication. Such proposals will be rejected for 100% sure.**
{: .fs-2 }

When making the duplication checks mentioned above, you may find that there are other observations on your target source(s) which can help your science case to some extent although they do not fully resolve the problem. For example, you may find that some short-spacing observations for your high-angular resolution experiment already exist. In this case, **explicitly mentioning how** you will make use of such complementary data in the proposal is a plus. Just mentioning you will use those data but without saying how usually does not help. If you have also checked the data archive of the observatories (e.g., ALMA, SMA, Herschel, Spitzer, etc) and found some useful complementary data, you can also mention how you will make use of them in a joint analysis. You might find some historical VLA images using the [NRAO image archive](http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~vlbacald/ArchIndex.shtml). Sometimes this helps your proposal preparation.

#### 1.3 Preparation-2: Scientific justification and technical details

To complete the proposal submission, you need a **title**, an **Abstract**, a PDF scientific justifications with **2 pages of text and 2 pages of Figures/Tables**. If you are not sure about how to compose the Abstract or the 2+2 pages scientific justification, check [here](https://baobabyoo.github.io/pages/students_topics/proposal_obs.html).
{: .fs-2 }

Usually, we prepare the 2+2 pages justifications using LaTEX. If you are my student/postdoc, please use the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) interface and share the link with me, *if you need my revision*. Use **fontsize 12** as far as you can. *Never make fontsize smaller than 11.* Do not use a very small margin. Try not to make your proposal over texty. No reviewer wants to spend more than **5 minutes** reading your proposal. Do not make it necessary for them to do so.
{: .fs-2 }

You will need to fill the technical details through the online interface. There are a lot of items to fill and many of them can be very complicated. Do prepare early unless you are already very experienced.

******************************************************************************

If you are proposing continuum experiment(s), you can simply use the standard 3-bit setup (or 8-bit if you are observing at L or S bands). If you want to change the correlator setup, you need to double check the maximum allowable data rate from [this page](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/oss/proposing), and check the [VLA Frequency Bands and Tunability](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/oss/performance/vla-frequency-bands-and-tunability). You can validate your **correlator setup** using the [GHOST tool](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/propvla/gost). Download this java tool and use the linux command `javaws latestGOST.jnlp` to launch it. It is **necessary** to re-download the latest version after the call for proposals was issued. When you are proposing a spectral line experiment, it is mandatory to use it and attach a screenshot to your proposal.
{: .fs-2 }

You can check the **sensitivity** *at your observing frequency* using the online [Sensitivity Estimator](https://obs.vla.nrao.edu/ect/). You need to export the sensitivity estimates using this page and attach to your proposal.

#### 1.4 Preparation-3: Scopes (being sufficiently ambitious)

A regular JVLA proposal usually requests from a few hours to a few tens of hours of observing time **for each array configuration**. Usually we try to limit the Ka and Q band time to <15 hours but there is not a hard rule for this. When your scientific goal is important and concrete, you should request the observing time that is needed to achieve your goal. Since 2021, there is an extra-large proposal category (X-proposal) that allows you to request up to 1000 hours of observing time. If you want to submit a X-proposal, prepare early.
{: .fs-2 }

If you are a Ph.D. student who already know what is your thesis project, and if your thesis project requires JVLA observations, do prepare the proposal early and submit the extra [Dissertation Plans](https://science.nrao.edu/observing/call-for-proposals/2023a/alerts-tips-for-proposers). It helps *DRAMATICALLY*. In this case, you can also propose observations for the future semester without being limited by what is stated in the [Array Configuration Schedule](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/proposing/configpropdeadlines). The request for the future semester(s) may be rejected. Nevertheless, this allows you to revise your proposal based on the Time Allocation Committee comments and then resubmit. It helps.

**Pick a problem that can be solved by such an investment resource.** You can think bigger once you have enough reputation to convince the reviewers that you can manage a larger-scale project.
