#### Astro-chemistry 


- **Background Physics**
    1. *General :* You need to read this textbook [Yamamoto (2007)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-4-431-54171-4). (You can download the PDF of the whole book)

- **Useful Codes and Data bases**
    1. Publicly available Numerical solver for chemical reaction: [astrochem](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ascl.soft07010M/abstract).
    2. Reaction rate coefficients:
        1. UMIST database: [McElroy et al. (2013)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...550A..36M/abstract)
        2. Self-sheidling of CO and H2: [Visser et al. (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...503..323V/abstract).
        3. Reaction with excited H2 molecules: [Visser et al.  (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...615A..75V/abstract)
