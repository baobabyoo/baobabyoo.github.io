#### Interstellar Dust (SED or Polarization)


-**Background Physics**
    1. *General :* You need to read through this review artical [Hildebrand (1983)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983QJRAS..24..267H/abstract).
    2. *Dust Polarization :* You need to read through this review artical [Hildebrand (2000)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000PASP..112.1215H/abstract).
-**Interferometry**
    1. *Textbook :* It is free to download the textbook [Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-44431-4) online. You need to read through at least the first 5 chapters.
    2. *Getting hand dirty :* It is good to walk through some of these [CASA Guides](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=ALMAguides). The example with the observations on the [TW Hya](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=TWHydraBand7) protoplanetary disk may be the easiest to begin with. If you work on polarization data, you will need to walk through the case of [3C286](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=3C286_Polarization).
