### Molecular Lines

The mass of a molecular cloud (typically n<sub>H2</sub> > 10<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>; the temperature is usually around 20 K, and can be heated to >100 K around some forming young stars) is dominated by molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). Besides H<sub>2</sub>, various molecules may present, including CO, OH, H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>, HCO<sup>+</sup>, HCN, CS, their isotopologues, and so on. In certain environments, there can also be carbon chain molecules (e.g., HC<sub>3</sub>H, HC<sub>7</sub>H) and/or organic molecules (e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>OH, CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>, etc). How to form these molecules is an interesting astrochemical question by itself.

The formation and destruction of the complex organic molecules are tightly related to the origin of life. For a review of this topic, you may check [Herbst and van Dishoeck (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ARA%26A..47..427H/abstract). If you are a physicist who hates chemistry, I found this book [Yamamoto (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017iace.book.....Y/abstract) to be very readable (I completed it and it was a very good reading experience for me). To see the connect to the origin of life, you may check [Pearce et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PNAS..11411327P/abstract) and references therein.

Even if you do not care about chemistry at all, it is still very important to learn about molecular line emission. The H<sub>2</sub> molecule has no dipole moment  such that it cannot emit efficiently. In spite that H<sub>2</sub> dominates the molecular cloud mass, we still cannot probe the physical properties of a molecular cloud by directly observing H<sub>2</sub>. Instead, we observe various molecular lines and regard them as *tracers* of physical quantities in a molecular cloud.

How this works (for a beginner, a good introduction may be [Evans 1999](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ARA%26A..37..311E/abstract))?

A specific molecule in the space (let's call it X molecule for this moment, which can be CO, SO, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, CH<sub>3</sub>CN, etc) has a range of energy states that are different in electron configuration. It can be pumped from a lower energy state to a higher energy state upon (i) collisions with other molecules, or (ii) by absorbing photons at some specific wavelengths. When an excited X molecule *is stimulated to* or *spontaneously* cascade from a high energy state (E=E<sub>up</sub>) to a low energy state (E=E<sub>low</sub>), it emits a photon that has energy equal to E<sub>up</sub>-E<sub>low</sub>. These processes are often introduced in the undergraduate-level quantum mechanics classes with a simplified, two-level system and with the Einstein A/B coefficients (e.g., see the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_coefficients)).

Now, if you have an ensemble of X molecules (i.e., a very large number of them), and if you know what are the energy states of an X molecule, for example, by a quantum mechanical recipe that is similar to the way you calculated the energy states of a hydrogen atom, then you can describe how the ensemble of X molecules are populating in the energy states, with an *(energy) distribution function*. If we observe multiple line transitions of molecule X, it may be possible to invert the observed **line intensity ratios** of these transitions to depict the (energy) distribution function (with some approximation or assumptions, usually). You may then infer the local physical properties from the depicted distribution function.

Note that we actually do not know the detailed energy states of all of the interstellar molecules. There need some quantum mechanical calculations and laboratory measurements. The energy states of NH<sub>3</sub> can be calculated exactly thus the observations of NH<sub>3</sub> have been widely applied since the late 1970s (for a review see [Ho and Townes 1983](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ARA%26A..21..239H/abstract)). Linear molecules like CO, CH<sub>3</sub>CN, and CH<sub>3</sub>CCH are also relatively well understood. Examples of observing some of these molecules in high-mass star-forming regions are [Liu et al. (2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...10L/abstract), [Liu et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...804...37L/abstract), and [Law et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909..214L/abstract). In contrast, it became possible to utilize CH<sub>3</sub>OH as a tracer only very recently, e.g., . [Leurini et al. (2004)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...422..573L/abstract).
