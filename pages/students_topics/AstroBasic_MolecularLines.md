### Molecular Lines

The mass of a molecular cloud (typically n<sub>H2</sub> > 10<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>; the temperature is usually around 20 K and can be heated to >100 K around some forming young stars) is dominated by molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). Besides H<sub>2</sub>, various molecules may present, including CO, OH, H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup>, HCN, CS, their isotopologues, and so on. In certain environments, there can also be carbon chain molecules (e.g., HC<sub>3</sub>H, HC<sub>7</sub>H) and/or organic molecules (e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>OH, CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>, etc). How to form these molecules is an interesting astrochemical question by itself. 

The formation and destruction of the complex organic molecules are tightly related to the origin of life. For a review of this topic, you may check [Herbst and van Dishoeck (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ARA%26A..47..427H/abstract). If you are a physicist who hates chemistry, I found this book [Yamamoto (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017iace.book.....Y/abstract) to be very readable (I completed it and it was a very good reading experience for me). To see the connect to the origin of life, you may check [Pearce et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PNAS..11411327P/abstract) and references therein.

Even if you do not care about chemistry at all, it is still very important to learn about molecular line emission. The H<sub>2</sub> molecule has no dipole moment  such that it cannot emit efficiently. In spite that H<sub>2</sub> dominates the molecular cloud mass, we still cannot probe the physical properties of a molecular cloud by directly observing H<sub>2</sub>. Instead, we observe various molecular lines and regard them as *tracers* of physical quantities in a molecular cloud.

How this work (for a beginner, a good introduction may be [Evans 1999](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ARA%26A..37..311E/abstract))?

A specific molecule in the space (let's call it X molecule for this moment, which can be CO, SO, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, CH<sub>3</sub>CN, etc) has a range of energy states that are different in electron configuration. It can be pumped from a lower energy state to a higher energy state upon (i) collisions with other molecules, or (ii) by absorbing photons at some specific wavelengths. When an excited X molecule *is stimulated to* or *spontaneously* cascade from a high energy state (E=E<sub>up</sub>) to a low energy state (E=E<sub>low</sub>), it emits a photo that has energy $h\nu=$E<sub>up</sub>-E<sub>low</sub>. These processes are often introduced in the undergraduate-level quantum mechanics classes with a simplifed, two-level system and with the Einstein A/B coefficients (e.g., see the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_coefficients)).
